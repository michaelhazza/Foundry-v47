# Build Transcript

> **Template generated by Agent 6.** This file is populated with actual results when `scripts/run-all-gates.sh` executes after implementation.

## Execution Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Build ID | GENERATED_AT_RUNTIME |
| Start Time | GENERATED_AT_RUNTIME |
| End Time | GENERATED_AT_RUNTIME |
| Total Gates | GENERATED_AT_RUNTIME |
| Passed | GENERATED_AT_RUNTIME |
| Failed | GENERATED_AT_RUNTIME |

> Populated by `scripts/run-all-gates.sh` - see `docs/build-gate-results.json` for structured results.

**Status:** TEMPLATE - Awaiting gate execution

## Script Extraction

Before implementation, run:
```bash
bash docs/gate-splitter.sh
```

This extracts 33 individual scripts from `docs/gate-scripts-reference.md`.

---

## Gate Inventory

**Expected:** 99+ gates (33 structural + per-entity expansion)

### Structural Gates (33 scripts)

See MANDATORY SCRIPTS LIST in agent-6-implementation-orchestrator.md

### Per-Entity Expansion Gates

Generated dynamically from JSON artifacts at runtime.
