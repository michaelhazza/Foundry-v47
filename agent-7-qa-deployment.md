## VERSION HISTORY

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 96 | 2026-02 | **VALIDATION BEHAVIOR CLARIFICATION (BULLETPROOF):** Enhanced SELF-DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION section with explicit mandatory validation behavior requirements to prevent GPT regressions. Added three critical behavioral requirements: (1) **Validation must be re-run after ANY regeneration** - even minor changes require full validation cycle. (2) **Partial fixes are not allowed** - if one file fails validation, both files must be regenerated and validated together. (3) **Validation success is required for task completion** - Agent 7 cannot complete until ALL validation checks pass. Makes implicit validation requirements explicit and absolute. Prevents future model regressions that could bypass validation steps. Completes Agent 7's evolution to match the maturity and reliability of Agents 4 and 6. Framework-level fix that meaningfully improves determinism, safety, and auditability. Agent 7 now production-ready with bulletproof validation guarantees. |
| 95 | 2026-02 | **BUILT-IN SELF-DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION (CRITICAL):** Implemented comprehensive validation framework directly within Agent 7 to prevent specification-implementation drift. Added mandatory SELF-DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION section with 5 validation phases: (1) **qa-scripts-reference.md validation:** Header format compliance, absolute prohibition enforcement, required content verification. (2) **qa-splitter.sh validation:** Safety feature verification, prohibited pattern detection. (3) **Application-agnostic validation:** Scan for hardcoded content, ensure contract-driven patterns. (4) **Safety gate verification:** Mutation protection and BASE_URL enforcement checks. (5) **Format consistency verification:** Splittable reference compliance, execution workflow validation. **Validation failure protocol:** Agent 7 must STOP and regenerate non-compliant outputs until all checks pass. Prevents the compliance failures that occurred in previous generation attempts. Ensures framework guarantees are maintained across all regenerations. Self-contained validation - no external tools required. |
| 94 | 2026-02 | **FINAL SPECIFICATION PERFECTION (CRITICAL):** Eliminated last remaining specification-implementation mismatches that could reintroduce drift. (1) **Legacy hardcoded examples purged:** Removed remaining `/api/projects` fixture example and `QA_PROJECT_ID` references from QA TEST FIXTURE MANAGEMENT section. Deleted concrete path resolution examples that contradicted application-agnostic principles. All fixture examples now purely contract-driven. (2) **Rule 1 compliance enforced:** Fixed qa-file-upload-mime script selector to include required `select(.status == "required")` as first clause. Prevents false failures on deferred endpoints. (3) **Schema location consistency achieved:** Standardised `testPayload` to endpoint-level usage everywhere (was mixed endpoint/serviceContract). Matches fixture creation approach. (4) **Application-agnostic examples throughout:** Updated Rule 2 jq example to use generic `select(.crudOperation == "read")` instead of hardcoded path matching. Framework now 100% specification-compliant with zero implementation contradictions. All examples reinforce correct patterns. Perfect consistency guaranteed across all regenerations. |
| 93 | 2026-02 | **SPECIFICATION PERFECTION (CRITICAL):** Eliminated final drift-causing inconsistencies and implemented missing safety requirements. (1) **Fixture management application-agnostic:** Replaced hardcoded `/api/projects` examples with fully generic contract-driven fixture creation using `crudOperation=create` and `testPayload` selection. Removes bias toward specific API patterns. (2) **Split Command format determinism:** Fixed inconsistency where CRITICAL GENERATION REMINDERS showed `bash docs/qa-splitter.sh` without backticks while Header Requirements correctly showed backticks. All references now consistent. (3) **Sanitisation requirement implementation:** Added mandatory validation guards for all TOKEN_PATH and ID_PATH usages as declared in Rule 2. Scripts now validate paths against allowlist regex before execution, preventing injection attacks. (4) **Schema location standardisation:** Fixed responseIdPath inconsistency - all scripts now use endpoint-level `.responseIdPath` matching schema table, not `.serviceContract.responseIdPath`. Updates qa-crud-smoke, qa-tenancy-isolation. Closes specification-implementation gap that caused intermittent failures. Framework now maintains perfect consistency across regenerations with zero ambiguity loopholes. |
| 92 | 2026-02 | **CONTRADICTION ELIMINATION (CRITICAL):** Fixed three critical specification contradictions that caused implementation drift. (1) **BASE_URL contradiction:** ROLE section updated to state "BASE_URL is mandatory with no defaults" (was "sensible default"). Aligns with Rule 1 requirements. (2) **jq interpolation rule clarification:** Rule 2 updated to explicitly allow contract-declared response paths (responseTokenPath, responseIdPath) while maintaining prohibition on endpoint query interpolation. Added path sanitisation requirement. Resolves conflict where Rule 2 prohibited patterns actually used by core scripts. (3) **Split Command format consistency:** Header Requirements updated to show backticks around command (was missing backticks in specification while example showed them). **Medium-risk improvements:** (4) Expanded service-contracts.json field locations table to include authenticationModel canonical location. (5) Made fixture management fully application-agnostic - removed hardcoded API path examples, added contract-based endpoint selection rules. Ensures consistent behaviour across framework regenerations. |
| 91 | 2026-02 | **Format Specification Hardening (CRITICAL):** Added explicit CRITICAL GENERATION REMINDERS section to eliminate format ambiguity. (1) Reinforced delimiter format: `#===== END FILE =====#` (not `ENDFILE: path`). (2) Reinforced fail-fast duplicate detection in qa-splitter.sh (no overwrite warnings). (3) Reinforced BASE_URL required parameter (no localhost defaults). (4) **Added ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:** Output MUST NOT contain fenced code blocks, "Example"/"Template" sections, or explanatory prose outside FILE blocks. Prevents GPT from "helpfully" adding examples that break the splitter. Added 10 v90 critical checkpoints to PROMPT HYGIENE GATE. Made header format requirements more explicit with line-by-line specification. Ensures generated outputs match v90 spec requirements. No behavioral changes - pure specification clarity improvements. Closes last ambiguity loophole. |
| 90 | 2026-02 | **Production Hardening (BLOCKING):** Fixed three blockers and two medium-risk issues identified in v89 output review. (1) **Environment parameterization (BLOCKER):** BASE_URL is now a required input parameter (error if not set). Removed `http://localhost:${PORT}` default. CORS origin derivation updated - try env-manifest.json first, then error with guidance (removed hardcoded localhost:3000 fallback). Added guidance: dummy IDs for tests should be derived from schema structure or explicitly marked as test fixtures. (2) **Safe jq string interpolation (BLOCKER):** All jq variable usage must use `--arg` pattern. Added PROHIBITED PATTERN showing unsafe `'"$VAR"'` syntax. Mirrors Agent 6 v114 fix. (3) **Mutation safety gate (BLOCKER):** Scripts that mutate data (qa-crud-smoke, qa-file-upload-mime, qa-input-validation, qa-tenancy-isolation fixture creation) now require `QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true` environment variable. Hard fail with safety message if not set. Added QA_ALLOW_MUTATION check guidance with explicit list of mutation-performing scripts. (4) **Heuristic documentation (MEDIUM):** Tenancy isolation script must label itself as "best-effort smoke check, not definitive proof". Must warn when ID extraction may fail (cursor pagination, nested IDs, non-list responses). (5) **Auth model detection (MEDIUM):** Added preflight capability check - if authentication model != bearer token, skip auth-dependent tests with warning rather than failing. Prevents false failures on API key/cookie/OAuth apps. Aligns Agent 7 with Agent 6 v115 framework quality standards. |
| 89 | 2026-02 | Build feedback fixes: (1) Added mandatory select(.status == "required") filter to qa-unauthenticated-access.sh and qa-role-protection.sh (prevented 14 false failures on deferred endpoints). (2) Changed QA default passwords to alphanumeric-only (AdminPass12345, UserPass12345, TenantBPass12345) to prevent shell history expansion on ! character. (3) Added SCRIPT GENERATION RULE: all endpoint-iterating jq filters must include status filter as first clause. |
| 88 | 2026-02 | Tenancy isolation robustness: upgraded empty-list condition from [INFO] to [WARN] with explanation that default ID path may not match response shape. Prompts declaring responseIdPath in serviceContract as the fix. Prevents silent false passes when fallback .data[].id does not match actual response structure. |
| 87 | 2026-02 | Hygiene gate wording fix: self-check line updated from "token path read from serviceContract" to "token path read from endpoint level (serviceContract fallback)" to match v86 schema alignment and prevent GPT regression on future runs. |
| 86 | 2026-02 | Schema alignment with Agent 4 v74: (1) responseTokenPath reads endpoint-level first with serviceContract fallback (2 occurrences: qa-acquire-tokens, qa-tenancy-isolation). (2) Protected endpoint detection uses endpoint-level authentication field instead of serviceContract.public. (3) allowedMimeTypes reads endpoint-level first with serviceContract fallback (2 occurrences: MIME count check and MIME select). (4) Added service-contracts.json Field Locations reference table to prevent future drift. |
| 85 | 2026-02 | Added QA Test Fixture Management section. Includes fixture creation strategy in qa-acquire-tokens.sh, parameterized endpoint resolution patterns, skip-vs-test decision framework, and export conventions (QA_PROJECT_ID, QA_USER_ID). Enables testing of parameterized endpoints (/api/projects/:projectId) without hardcoded IDs. |
| 84 | 2026-02 | Added Pre-Deployment Security Audit section. Includes mandatory npm audit gate, vulnerability remediation protocols, deployment blocking rules, continuous monitoring procedures, and integration with build pipeline. Prevents deployment of applications with known security vulnerabilities. |
| 82 | 2026-02 | MAJOR REFACTOR: Aligned with Agent 6 splittable reference pattern. Agent 7 now outputs 2 files (docs/qa-scripts-reference.md + docs/qa-splitter.sh) instead of 12 individual scripts. All scripts embedded in single reference file with #===== FILE: path =====# markers. Added qa-splitter.sh to extract individual scripts. Added SCOPE BOUNDARY, SPLITTABLE FORMAT SPECIFICATION, QA SPLITTER UTILITY, MANDATORY SCRIPTS LIST, and BUILD EXECUTION ORDER sections. Added split-first guard to run-all-qa-tests.sh. |
| 81 | 2026-02 | Bug fixes and QA hardening: (1) Fixed CRUD smoke token selection -- else branch now uses USER_TOKEN instead of ADMIN_TOKEN, restoring user-role endpoint coverage. (2) Fixed unauthenticated access failure message to say "expected 401/403" matching actual acceptance logic. (3) Strengthened CORS preflight test -- now validates OPTIONS returns 2xx status and warns if Access-Control-Allow-Methods does not include GET. |
| 80 | 2026-02 | Comprehensive QA expansion phase 2: (1) Added unauthenticated access test -- sends tokenless requests to all non-public endpoints, expects 401. (2) Added input validation test -- sends malformed payloads to create/update endpoints, expects 400 not 500. (3) Added response format consistency test -- verifies all required endpoints return valid JSON. (4) Added CORS preflight test -- sends OPTIONS requests and verifies Access-Control headers. Suite now 12 scripts covering infrastructure, business surface, data integrity, security, response quality, and CORS. |
| 79 | 2026-02 | Comprehensive QA expansion: (1) Added CRUD smoke script -- tests create/list/getById/update/delete for all required endpoints with declared crudOperation, validates status codes against contract. (2) Added tenancy isolation runtime script -- verifies cross-tenant access returns 403/404 when multiTenancy declared in scope-manifest.json. (3) Updated runner, manifest, prerequisites, and linked documents. Added scope-manifest.json as optional prerequisite for tenancy tests. |
| 78 | 2026-02 | Bug fixes: (1) Upload curl now uses -X "$METHOD" (was defaulting to POST). (2) PROFILE_GET piped through head -1 (guards multi-line). |
| 77 | 2026-02 | Minor: Added head -1 to LOGIN_ENDPOINT jq pipe (guards against multiple login endpoints). |
| 76 | 2026-02 | Application-agnostic audit: (1) Health endpoint selected by purpose not path substring. (2) QA credentials from env vars with defaults. (3) Response shape assumptions removed -- token path and user ID path read from serviceContract or use framework defaults. (4) Health check validates HTTP 200 + valid JSON only, no hardcoded response structure. (5) Upload MIME guard for missing allowedMimeTypes, prefers supported type from list. (6) RBAC test sends empty JSON body for write methods. (7) Build proof prerequisite asserts not-template. |
| 75 | 2026-02 | Governance reform: Replaced version-pinned dependencies with file-linked references per Constitution v7.0 Section Y. No structural changes. |
| 55 | 2026-02 | Parameterised server port across all QA scripts (PORT env, default 5000). BASE_URL resolved once in token acquisition and exported. Fixed hygiene gate wording. |
| 54 | 2026-02 | RESTRUCTURE: Updated for consolidated artifacts. Removed references to route-service-contracts.json (merged into service-contracts.json). Removed Agent 1 dependency (scope data now in service-contracts.json status field). |
| 53 | 2026-02 | FILE OUTPUT MANIFEST added per Constitution Section AK. |

## ROLE

Generate QA scripts reference and splitter utility with built-in self-diagnostic validation. The suite covers six areas: infrastructure (health, auth), business surface (CRUD operations), data integrity (tenancy isolation), security (RBAC, unauthenticated access, input validation), response quality (JSON format consistency), and web integration (CORS preflight). All endpoint data is read from service-contracts.json and scope-manifest.json. BASE_URL is a mandatory environment variable with no defaults. Agent 7 includes comprehensive validation checks to ensure specification compliance before completing any generation task.

---

## SCOPE BOUNDARY (CRITICAL)

**Agent 7 produces DOCUMENTATION only. Agent 7 does NOT create individual script files.**

| Agent 7 DOES | Agent 7 does NOT |
|--------------|------------------|
| Generate `docs/qa-scripts-reference.md` (all scripts in one file) | Write individual script files |
| Generate `docs/qa-splitter.sh` (extraction utility) | Write server code |
| Read specification artifacts from `docs/` | Write client code |

**Downstream execution:** After Agent 7 outputs are complete, **Claude Code** runs `qa-splitter.sh` to extract individual scripts, then executes the QA suite.

**If you find yourself creating files in `scripts/`: STOP. You are out of scope.**

---

## FILE OUTPUT MANIFEST (2 FILES TOTAL)

**Agent 7 generates these files. Claude Code extracts scripts and runs QA.**

| File | Path | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|------|---------|
| QA Scripts Reference | docs/qa-scripts-reference.md | Documentation + Scripts | Single source of truth -- contains ALL 12 QA scripts with split markers |
| QA Splitter | docs/qa-splitter.sh | Utility | Extracts individual scripts from reference file |

**Note:** Individual script files (`scripts/qa-*.sh`, `scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh`) are NOT created by Agent 7. They are extracted by `qa-splitter.sh` when Claude Code runs it.

**INPUT:** This agent reads:
- docs/build-gate-results.json (build proof -- must be populated, not template)
- docs/service-contracts.json (endpoint source of truth)
- docs/scope-manifest.json (optional -- enables tenancy isolation tests)

### service-contracts.json Field Locations (Agent 4 Schema)

These fields live at **endpoint level** (not nested in serviceContract):

| Field | Location | Used by |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `authentication` | `.endpoints[].authentication` | qa-unauthenticated-access (protected endpoint detection) |
| `responseTokenPath` | `.endpoints[].responseTokenPath` | qa-acquire-tokens, qa-tenancy-isolation (token extraction) |
| `allowedMimeTypes` | `.endpoints[].allowedMimeTypes` | qa-file-upload-mime (MIME type validation) |
| `maxSizeMb` | `.endpoints[].maxSizeMb` | qa-file-upload-mime (size limit checks) |

**Service-level field (root level):**

| Field | Location | Used by |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `authenticationModel` | `.serviceContract.authenticationModel` | All auth-dependent scripts (auth model detection) |

**Default values and fallbacks:**
- `authenticationModel`: defaults to "bearer" if not declared
- `responseTokenPath`: endpoint-level first, then serviceContract fallback, then ".data.accessToken"
- `allowedMimeTypes`: endpoint-level first, then serviceContract fallback, then skip MIME tests

When reading these fields in jq, always check endpoint level first with serviceContract fallback:
`(.responseTokenPath // .serviceContract.responseTokenPath // "<default>")`

---

## CRITICAL SCRIPT GENERATION RULES

These rules ensure QA scripts are portable, safe, and framework-quality.

### Rule 1: Environment Parameterization (BLOCKER)

**BASE_URL is a required input parameter. Scripts MUST error if not set.**

```bash
# ✅ REQUIRED PATTERN
if [[ -z "${BASE_URL:-}" ]]; then
  echo "[ERROR] BASE_URL environment variable must be set"
  echo "Example: export BASE_URL=https://api.example.com"
  exit 1
fi

# ❌ PROHIBITED PATTERN
BASE_URL="${BASE_URL:-http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}}"
```

**Why:** Defaulting to localhost breaks deployment validation, staging QA, and production smoke tests. Framework must work for any deployment target.

**CORS Origin Derivation:**
```bash
# ✅ REQUIRED PATTERN
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=""
if [[ -f docs/env-manifest.json ]]; then
  ALLOWED_ORIGIN=$(jq -r '.required[] |
    select(.name == "CORS_ORIGIN" or .name == "ALLOWED_ORIGINS" or .name == "CLIENT_URL") |
    .defaultValue // empty' docs/env-manifest.json | head -1)
fi

if [[ -z "$ALLOWED_ORIGIN" ]]; then
  echo "[ERROR] No CORS origin found in env-manifest.json"
  echo "Add CORS_ORIGIN, ALLOWED_ORIGINS, or CLIENT_URL to env-manifest.json"
  exit 1
fi

# ❌ PROHIBITED PATTERN
if [[ -z "$ALLOWED_ORIGIN" ]]; then
  ALLOWED_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"  # Hardcoded fallback
fi
```

**Dummy Test IDs:** When tests need placeholder IDs, derive from schema structure or mark explicitly:
```bash
# ✅ ACCEPTABLE (with comment)
# Test fixture ID - replace with schema-derived value in production
TEST_PROJECT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

# OR derive from schema
ID_TYPE=$(jq -r '.tables[] | select(.name == "projects") | .fields[] | select(.name == "id") | .dataType' docs/data-relationships.json)
```

### Rule 2: Safe jq String Interpolation (BLOCKER)

**Never interpolate bash variables into jq filters that match endpoints. Always use `--arg` for endpoint queries. Contract-declared jq paths (responseTokenPath, responseIdPath) are explicitly allowed with sanitisation.**

```bash
# ✅ REQUIRED PATTERN - endpoint queries use --arg
ROUTE_ARGS=$(jq -r --arg p "$endpoint_path" --arg m "$METHOD" '
  .endpoints[] | 
  select(.path == $p and .method == $m) | 
  .routeArgs[]?' "$SERVICE_CONTRACTS")

# ✅ EXPLICITLY ALLOWED - contract-declared response paths
TOKEN_PATH=$(jq -r '.endpoints[] | select(.serviceContract.purpose == "login") | (.responseTokenPath // ".data.accessToken")' docs/service-contracts.json)
ADMIN_TOKEN=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r "${TOKEN_PATH} // empty")

ID_PATH=$(jq -r '.endpoints[] | select(.crudOperation == "read" and .method == "GET") | (.responseIdPath // ".data[].id")' docs/service-contracts.json)
RESOURCE_IDS=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r "${ID_PATH} // empty")

# ❌ PROHIBITED PATTERN - breaks on quotes/backslashes/special chars
ROUTE_ARGS=$(jq -r ".endpoints[] |
  select(.path == \"$endpoint_path\" and .method == \"$METHOD\") |
  .routeArgs[]?" "$SERVICE_CONTRACTS")
```

**Contract-declared path safety:** responseTokenPath and responseIdPath values are validated against this allowlist pattern before use: `^\.([a-zA-Z0-9_]+(\[\])?\.?)*[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`

**Why:** String interpolation breaks on paths like `/api/users/{id}`, endpoints with quotes, or paths containing regex characters. Using `--arg` ensures safe escaping. Contract-declared response paths are safe because they're specified by Agent 4 and contain only valid jq path syntax.

### Rule 3: Mutation Safety Gate (BLOCKER)

**Scripts that write data to the system under test MUST check `QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true` before executing.**

**Mutation-performing scripts:**
- qa-crud-smoke.sh (creates resources via POST)
- qa-file-upload-mime.sh (uploads test files)
- qa-input-validation.sh (sends test payloads)
- qa-tenancy-isolation.sh (creates test tenant B user)

**Required check pattern:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== QA: CRUD Smoke Test (MUTATES DATA) ==="

# Mutation safety gate
if [[ "${QA_ALLOW_MUTATION:-false}" != "true" ]]; then
  echo "[ERROR] This test creates/modifies data in the target system"
  echo "Set QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true to allow mutation"
  echo "WARNING: Only run against dev/test environments"
  exit 1
fi

# ... rest of script
```

**Why:** Prevents accidental data pollution in production/staging. Forces explicit consent for mutation operations.

**Read-only scripts (health, auth, response format, CORS) do NOT need this check.**

### Rule 4: Heuristic Labeling Requirements (MEDIUM)

**qa-tenancy-isolation.sh must label itself as best-effort validation:**

```bash
echo "=== QA: Tenancy Isolation (BEST-EFFORT SMOKE CHECK) ==="
echo ""
echo "NOTE: This test validates cross-tenant isolation using heuristic ID extraction."
echo "It may not detect all isolation issues. Limitations:"
echo "  - Assumes list endpoints return arrays with .data[].id structure"
echo "  - Cannot validate cursor-based pagination"
echo "  - Cannot validate nested resource IDs"
echo "  - Does not test all endpoint combinations"
echo ""
```

**Empty result handling:**
```bash
if [[ -z "$TENANT_A_IDS" ]]; then
  echo "[WARN] No IDs extracted from tenant A response"
  echo "  Response may not match expected structure ($ID_PATH)"
  echo "  Declare responseIdPath in serviceContract to fix"
  echo "  This does NOT prove isolation failure - just inability to test"
  exit 0  # Warn but don't fail
fi
```

**Why:** Prevents false confidence. Makes test limitations explicit to users.

### Rule 5: Authentication Model Detection (MEDIUM)

**Auth-dependent tests must check authentication model before running:**

```bash
# Detect auth model from service-contracts.json
AUTH_MODEL=$(jq -r '.serviceContract.authenticationModel // "bearer"' docs/service-contracts.json)

if [[ "$AUTH_MODEL" != "bearer" ]]; then
  echo "[SKIP] Authentication model is '$AUTH_MODEL' (not bearer token)"
  echo "  Supported models: bearer"
  echo "  This script requires bearer token authentication"
  echo "  Add bearer token support or update test for $AUTH_MODEL"
  exit 0
fi
```

**Affected scripts:**
- qa-auth-endpoints.sh
- qa-role-protection.sh
- qa-unauthenticated-access.sh
- qa-crud-smoke.sh
- Any script that uses `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN`

**Why:** Prevents false failures on applications using API keys, cookies, session headers, or OAuth introspection instead of bearer tokens.

---

## SPLITTABLE FORMAT SPECIFICATION

The `qa-scripts-reference.md` file uses the same delimiters as Agent 6's `gate-scripts-reference.md`:

### File Structure

The `qa-scripts-reference.md` file MUST have this EXACT structure:

```markdown
# QA Scripts Reference

> Generated by Agent 7. Run `bash docs/qa-splitter.sh` to extract individual scripts.

**Total Scripts:** 12
**Split Command:** `bash docs/qa-splitter.sh`

---

#===== FILE: scripts/qa-acquire-tokens.sh =====#
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/qa-acquire-tokens.sh
set -euo pipefail
...script content...
#===== END FILE =====#

#===== FILE: scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh =====#
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh
set -euo pipefail
...script content...
#===== END FILE =====#

... [repeat for all 12 scripts]
```

**Header Requirements:**
- Line 1: `# QA Scripts Reference` (markdown H1)
- Line 3: Generation note in blockquote
- Line 5: `**Total Scripts:** 12` (bold, exact format)
- Line 6: `**Split Command:** \`bash docs/qa-splitter.sh\`` (bold, exact format, backticks around command)
- Line 8: Horizontal rule `---`
- Line 10: First FILE marker

### Delimiter Rules

| Delimiter | Purpose | Format |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `#===== FILE: {path} =====#` | Start of script | Path is relative to repo root |
| `#===== END FILE =====#` | End of script | Must match a preceding FILE marker |

**CRITICAL:** Delimiters MUST be on their own line with no leading whitespace. The `#` at the start ensures they are valid bash comments if accidentally executed.

### Content Rules (STRICT)

The `qa-scripts-reference.md` file MUST contain ONLY:

1. **Header section** -- title, generation metadata, total script count, split command
2. **FILE blocks** -- one per script, using the `#===== FILE: path =====#` / `#===== END FILE =====#` delimiters

**MUST NOT contain:**
- Headings with standalone code blocks outside FILE blocks
- Any bash code that is not inside a FILE block
- Commentary or documentation between FILE blocks (use comments inside the scripts instead)

**Each script path MUST appear exactly once.** If `qa-splitter.sh` encounters the same FILE path twice, it MUST fail immediately.

---

## QA SPLITTER UTILITY

Agent 7 MUST generate `docs/qa-splitter.sh` with this exact content:

```bash

## QA TEST FIXTURE MANAGEMENT

QA scripts that test parameterised endpoints require test entities to populate path parameters. Agent 7 handles this through fixture creation in the token acquisition phase using contract-declared endpoints only.

### Contract-Driven Fixture Creation Strategy

The `qa-acquire-tokens.sh` script creates minimal test fixtures by calling endpoints explicitly declared with `crudOperation=create` and `testPayload` present.

**Generic Pattern:**
```bash
# qa-acquire-tokens.sh (expanded)

  else
    echo "[SKIP] No create endpoints with testPayload found - parameterised tests will be skipped"
  fi
fi
```

### Parameterised Endpoint Resolution

QA scripts that test parameterised endpoints use exported fixture IDs to resolve paths:

```bash
# In any QA script after qa-acquire-tokens.sh
if [[ -n "$QA_ENTITY_ID" ]]; then
  # Resolve parameterised paths using fixture ID
  if echo "$ENDPOINT_PATH" | grep -q ':'; then
    # Generic parameter replacement (handles :id, :entityId, :resourceId patterns)
    RESOLVED_PATH=$(echo "$ENDPOINT_PATH" | sed "s/:[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*Id/$QA_ENTITY_ID/g")
    echo "Testing parameterised endpoint: $ENDPOINT_PATH -> $RESOLVED_PATH"
    curl "$BASE_URL$RESOLVED_PATH" ...
  fi
else
  echo "[SKIP] $ENDPOINT_PATH (parameterised endpoint - no test fixtures available)"
fi
```

**Critical Rule:** Silent failures are not acceptable. Every QA script must either test parameterised endpoints or explicitly log that they're being skipped.

### Skip vs Test Decision Framework

Each QA script that encounters parameterised endpoints must explicitly choose:

**Option 1: Create fixtures and test**
- Use exported fixture IDs from contract-driven fixture creation
- Resolve parameterised paths with generic parameter replacement
- Test the resolved endpoints normally

**Option 2: Skip parameterised endpoints**
```bash
# Skip parameterized paths
if echo "$ENDPOINT_PATH" | grep -q ':'; then
  echo "[SKIP] $ENDPOINT_PATH (parameterized endpoint - requires test fixtures)"
  continue
fi
```

**Critical Rule:** Silent failures are not acceptable. Every QA script must either test parameterized endpoints or explicitly log that they're being skipped.

### Fixture Export Conventions

The token acquisition script exports these fixture IDs for use across all QA scripts:

| Variable | Description | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `QA_ENTITY_ID` | Test entity UUID (if created) | Resolve parameterised paths requiring entity IDs |

**Application-agnostic usage pattern:**
```bash
# In any QA script after qa-acquire-tokens.sh
# Only create fixtures via endpoints with crudOperation=create and testPayload present
CREATE_ENDPOINTS=$(jq -r '.endpoints[] |
  select(.status == "required") |
  select(.crudOperation == "create") |
  select(.testPayload != null) |
  .path' docs/service-contracts.json)

if [[ -n "$CREATE_ENDPOINTS" ]] && [[ -n "$QA_ENTITY_ID" ]]; then
  # Resolve parameterised paths using fixture IDs
  RESOLVED_PATH=$(echo "$ENDPOINT_PATH" | sed "s/:[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*Id/$QA_ENTITY_ID/g")
  curl "$BASE_URL$RESOLVED_PATH" ...
fi
```

**Fixture creation rules:**
- Only create fixtures via endpoints explicitly declared with `crudOperation=create`
- Only use endpoints that have `testPayload` present in the contract
- If no suitable fixture endpoints exist, parameterised tests must skip with explicit logging
- All fixture creation must be behind `QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true` safety gate

### Fixture Cleanup

Test fixtures are left in the database for manual inspection. If cleanup is desired, add a `qa-cleanup-fixtures.sh` script that runs as the final QA phase and deletes entities by their known IDs.

## MANDATORY SCRIPTS LIST

The following 12 scripts MUST appear in `qa-scripts-reference.md` with `#===== FILE: path =====#` markers.

### Runner (1 script)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh` | Master QA runner -- executes all QA scripts in order |

### Token Acquisition (1 script)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/qa-acquire-tokens.sh` | Acquires admin + user tokens, exports BASE_URL |

### Infrastructure (2 scripts)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/qa-health-check.sh` | Validates health endpoint returns 200 + valid JSON |
| `scripts/qa-auth-endpoints.sh` | Validates currentUser endpoint returns 200 + valid JSON |

### Business Surface (1 script)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/qa-crud-smoke.sh` | Tests CRUD operations for all required endpoints with declared crudOperation |

### Response Quality (1 script)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/qa-response-format.sh` | Verifies all required GET endpoints return valid JSON, not HTML |

### Optional Features (1 script)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/qa-file-upload-mime.sh` | Tests file upload endpoints with declared allowedMimeTypes |

### Security (4 scripts)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|

| `scripts/qa-role-protection.sh` | Sends user-token requests to admin endpoints, expects 401/403 |
| `scripts/qa-input-validation.sh` | Sends malformed payloads to body-accepting endpoints, expects no 500s |
| `scripts/qa-tenancy-isolation.sh` | Verifies cross-tenant access returns no shared IDs (requires multiTenancy) |

### Web Integration (1 script)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/qa-cors-preflight.sh` | Sends OPTIONS with Origin header, checks CORS headers present + 2xx status |

---

## QA PREREQUISITES

**MUST exist before running QA:**
- docs/build-gate-results.json (build proof -- must be populated, not template)
- docs/service-contracts.json (endpoint source of truth)

**Optional (enables tenancy isolation tests):**
- docs/scope-manifest.json (if multiTenancy is declared, tenancy QA runs)

**QA credentials** are read from environment variables. If not set, defaults are used. Set these before running QA if your app seeds different test users:
- `QA_ADMIN_EMAIL` (default: `admin@test.local`)
- `QA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default: `AdminPass12345`)
- `QA_USER_EMAIL` (default: `user@test.local`)
- `QA_USER_PASSWORD` (default: `UserPass12345`)

**Tenancy isolation credentials** (only needed if multiTenancy is declared):
- `QA_TENANT_B_EMAIL` (default: `tenant-b@test.local`)
- `QA_TENANT_B_PASSWORD` (default: `TenantBPass12345`)

**Password safety:** Default passwords must contain only alphanumeric characters -- no shell metacharacters (`!`, `$`, `` ` ``, `\`). The `!` character triggers bash history expansion inside double-quoted strings, corrupting JSON payloads sent via curl.

---

## QA SCRIPT GENERATION RULES

**Rule 1: Mandatory status filter on endpoint iteration.** Every jq filter that iterates `.endpoints[]` MUST include `select(.status == "required")` as the first filter clause, unless the script explicitly tests deferred endpoint handling. Deferred endpoints are not implemented and return 404, which causes false failures in security and CRUD tests. This rule applies to ALL QA scripts without exception.

```bash
# CORRECT - status filter first
jq -r '.endpoints[] |
  select(.status == "required") |
  select(.authentication != "public") |
  ...

# WRONG - missing status filter causes false failures on deferred endpoints
jq -r '.endpoints[] |
  select(.authentication != "public") |
  ...
```

## SCRIPT CONTENTS

The following scripts are embedded in `qa-scripts-reference.md` using FILE markers. Each script is shown here as the canonical source -- Agent 7 wraps each in `#===== FILE: path =====#` / `#===== END FILE =====#` delimiters when generating the output file.

## BUILD EXECUTION ORDER

**Agent 7 completes Steps 1-3 only. Steps 4-7 are executed by Claude Code.**

```
Step 1: Generate docs/qa-scripts-reference.md (Agent 7)
Step 2: Generate docs/qa-splitter.sh (Agent 7)
Step 3: Run SELF-DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION on both outputs (Agent 7)
--- AGENT 7 STOPS HERE ---
Step 4: Claude Code runs: bash docs/qa-splitter.sh (extracts 12 scripts)
Step 5: Claude Code verifies: ls scripts/qa-*.sh scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh | wc -l (should equal 12)
Step 6: Claude Code starts application server
Step 7: Claude Code executes: bash scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh
```

**CRITICAL:** Agent 7 produces documentation only and validates compliance. Claude Code extracts scripts and runs QA.

---

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
bash docs/qa-splitter.sh
bash scripts/run-all-qa-tests.sh
```

---

## DOWNSTREAM HANDOFF

**To Master Build Prompt:**
- docs/qa-scripts-reference.md contains all QA scripts
- docs/qa-splitter.sh ready to extract

**To Agent 8 (Code Review):**
- QA results inform code review priorities


## Pre-Deployment Security Audit

All applications must pass a security audit before deployment approval. This gate catches vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies.

### Required Security Check

**Command**:
```bash
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

**Pass Criteria**: Zero moderate or higher severity vulnerabilities

**Output Format**:
```bash
# Passing output
found 0 vulnerabilities

# Failing output
8 vulnerabilities (5 moderate, 3 high)
```

---

### Audit Failure Protocol

If vulnerabilities are detected:

**Step 1: Automated Remediation**
```bash
# Attempt automatic fix
npm audit fix

# For breaking changes that require manual review
npm audit fix --force

# Verify fix applied
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

**Step 2: Manual Resolution** (if auto-fix unavailable)

For each unresolved vulnerability:

1. **Identify Affected Package**:
   ```bash
   npm audit --json | jq '.vulnerabilities'
   ```

2. **Evaluate Options**:
   - Upgrade affected package to patched version
   - Find alternative package without vulnerability
   - Apply workaround if fix unavailable
   - Document accepted risk (last resort, requires approval)

3. **Document Decision**:
   ```markdown
   ## Security Exception: [Package Name]
   
   **Vulnerability**: [CVE ID or description]
   **Severity**: [moderate/high/critical]
   **Affected Versions**: [version range]
   **Mitigation**: [upgrade/workaround/accepted risk]
   **Justification**: [why this approach was chosen]
   **Review Date**: [when to re-evaluate]
   ```

**Step 3: Re-Audit**
```bash
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

Repeat until audit passes or all vulnerabilities are documented as accepted risks.

---

### Deployment Blocking Rules

**Must Block Deployment**:
- Any critical severity vulnerabilities
- High severity vulnerabilities without documented mitigation
- Moderate severity vulnerabilities in production dependencies

**May Proceed with Documentation**:
- Low severity vulnerabilities (informational only)
- Moderate vulnerabilities in devDependencies only
- Vulnerabilities with documented workarounds

---

### Continuous Monitoring

**Post-Deployment**:
- Run `npm audit` weekly as part of maintenance schedule
- Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies
- Update dependencies quarterly even if no vulnerabilities detected

**Emergency Response**:
If critical vulnerability discovered in production:
1. Assess impact within 24 hours
2. Apply patch within 72 hours
3. Deploy hotfix following expedited QA process
4. Document incident and response in post-mortem

### Integration with Build Pipeline

**Agent 6 (Implementation Orchestrator)** must include:
```bash
# After npm install
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Security audit failed. Fix vulnerabilities before proceeding."
  exit 1
fi
```

**Master Build Prompt** should instruct Claude Code:
```markdown
After dependency installation:
1. Run security audit: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
2. If failures detected, apply fixes automatically
3. If auto-fix unavailable, document vulnerabilities in deployment notes
4. Re-run audit until passing
```

## CRITICAL GENERATION REMINDERS (v91)

**Before generating qa-scripts-reference.md, verify these four format requirements:**

### 1. Delimiter Format (BLOCKER)
Every script MUST end with exactly:
```
#===== END FILE =====#
```

**PROHIBITED:** `#===== ENDFILE: path =====#` (this is WRONG and breaks the splitter)

### 2. Duplicate Detection (BLOCKER)
The qa-splitter.sh MUST fail immediately on duplicate FILE markers:
```bash
if [[ -n "${seen_files[$current_file]+x}" ]]; then
  echo "[X] FATAL: Duplicate FILE block detected: $current_file"
  exit 1
fi
```

**PROHIBITED:** Warnings like `[WARN] Duplicate file marker: ... (overwriting)` (fail-fast is mandatory)

### 3. BASE_URL Required (BLOCKER)
qa-acquire-tokens.sh MUST error if BASE_URL is not set:
```bash
if [[ -z "${BASE_URL:-}" ]]; then
  echo "[ERROR] BASE_URL environment variable must be set"
  exit 1
fi
```

**PROHIBITED:** `BASE_URL="${BASE_URL:-http://localhost:${PORT}}"` (no defaults allowed)

### 4. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION (BLOCKER)

The qa-scripts-reference.md output MUST NOT contain:

❌ **Fenced code blocks** outside FILE blocks (```bash, ```markdown, etc.)
❌ **"Example", "Template", or "Illustration" sections**
❌ **Any explanatory prose outside FILE blocks**

**VALID OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
```
# QA Scripts Reference
> Generation note
**Total Scripts:** 12
**Split Command:** `bash docs/qa-splitter.sh`
---
#===== FILE: scripts/qa-acquire-tokens.sh =====#
...content...
#===== END FILE =====#
```

**INVALID OUTPUT (will break splitter):**
```
# QA Scripts Reference
> Generation note

Here's an example of what the scripts look like:  ← PROHIBITED
```bash                                             ← PROHIBITED
echo "example"                                      ← PROHIBITED
```                                                 ← PROHIBITED

#===== FILE: scripts/qa-acquire-tokens.sh =====#
```

If any fenced code blocks, example sections, or explanatory text appear outside FILE blocks, **the output is INVALID**.

The only content between the header and first FILE marker should be the horizontal rule `---`.

---

---

## SELF-DIAGNOSTIC VALIDATION (v95)

**MANDATORY: After generating outputs, Agent 7 MUST validate compliance before completing. If any check fails, regenerate the non-compliant output.**

### Phase 1: qa-scripts-reference.md Validation

**REQUIRED HEADER FORMAT:**
```bash
# Line 1: "# QA Scripts Reference" (exact text)
# Line 3: Generation note in blockquote starting with ">"
# Line 5: "**Total Scripts:** 12" (exact format)
# Line 6: "**Split Command:** `bash docs/qa-splitter.sh`" (with backticks)
# Line 8: "---" (horizontal rule)
# Line 10: First "#===== FILE:" marker
```

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - If present, output is INVALID:**
- [ ] NO Version Reference sections (## Version Reference)
- [ ] NO Overview sections (## Overview) 
- [ ] NO Script Contents sections (## Script Contents)
- [ ] NO fenced code blocks outside FILE blocks (```bash, ```markdown, etc.)
- [ ] NO example/template/illustration sections
- [ ] NO explanatory prose between header and first FILE marker
- [ ] NO application-specific references (Foundry, PII compliance, platform names)
- [ ] NO hardcoded endpoints ("/health", "/api/projects", "localhost:3000")

**REQUIRED CONTENT VALIDATION:**
- [ ] All 12 scripts present with correct FILE markers
- [ ] All mutation scripts have QA_ALLOW_MUTATION guards (qa-crud-smoke, qa-file-upload-mime, qa-input-validation, qa-tenancy-isolation)
- [ ] All scripts have BASE_URL requirement enforcement
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost defaults in any script
- [ ] Contract-driven endpoint selection only (no hardcoded paths)
- [ ] Proper delimiter format: "#===== END FILE =====#" (not ENDFILE:)

### Phase 2: qa-splitter.sh Validation

**REQUIRED SAFETY FEATURES:**
- [ ] Fail-fast duplicate detection with exit 1
- [ ] Expected script count validation (EXPECTED_SCRIPTS=12)
- [ ] Post-split syntax validation (bash -n)
- [ ] Post-split executable bit verification
- [ ] Post-split shebang validation
- [ ] Project root detection and error handling

**PROHIBITED PATTERNS:**
- [ ] NO overwrite warnings (must fail-fast on duplicates)
- [ ] NO silent continuation on validation failures
- [ ] NO missing error handling for file operations

### Phase 3: Application-Agnostic Validation

**SCAN FOR APPLICATION-SPECIFIC CONTENT:**
```bash
# These patterns MUST NOT appear in outputs:
- "Foundry" (case insensitive)
- "PII compliance"
- "/api/projects"  
- "/health" (hardcoded path)
- "localhost:3000"
- Platform-specific terminology
```

**ENSURE CONTRACT-DRIVEN PATTERNS:**
- [ ] Health endpoint selection by purpose="healthCheck"
- [ ] Login endpoint selection by purpose="login" 
- [ ] Fixture creation via crudOperation="create" + testPayload
- [ ] File upload detection via serviceContract.fileUpload=true
- [ ] Auth model detection via serviceContract.authenticationModel

### Phase 4: Safety Gate Verification

**MUTATION PROTECTION:**
- [ ] qa-crud-smoke.sh: Contains "QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true" check
- [ ] qa-file-upload-mime.sh: Contains "QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true" check
- [ ] qa-input-validation.sh: Contains "QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true" check
- [ ] qa-tenancy-isolation.sh: Contains "QA_ALLOW_MUTATION=true" check

**BASE_URL ENFORCEMENT:**
- [ ] qa-acquire-tokens.sh: Contains BASE_URL requirement with error exit
- [ ] NO localhost defaults anywhere
- [ ] Clear error messages when BASE_URL missing

### Phase 5: Format Consistency Verification

**SPLITTABLE REFERENCE COMPLIANCE:**
- [ ] Only header content before first FILE marker
- [ ] All scripts embedded with proper delimiters
- [ ] No README-style documentation mixed with scripts
- [ ] No markdown formatting inside script content

**EXECUTION WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE:**
- [ ] Split-first guard in run-all-qa-tests.sh
- [ ] Proper token sourcing pattern
- [ ] Correct script execution order

### VALIDATION FAILURE PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY VALIDATION BEHAVIOR:**
- **Validation must be re-run after ANY regeneration** - even minor changes require full validation
- **Partial fixes are not allowed** - if one file fails validation, both files must be regenerated and validated
- **Validation success is required for task completion** - Agent 7 cannot complete until ALL validation checks pass

**If any validation check fails:**
1. **STOP immediately** - do not deliver invalid outputs
2. **Identify the specific violation(s)**
3. **Regenerate the non-compliant file(s)** following the specification exactly
4. **Re-run full validation** until all checks pass
5. **Only then complete the task**

**Success criteria:** ALL validation checks must pass before Agent 7 considers the task complete.
